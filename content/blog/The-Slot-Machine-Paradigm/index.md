description: Novice programmers beware! Variable ratio reinforcement schedules can damage your development!

[Variable ratio reinforcement schedules](https://www.simplypsychology.org/schedules-of-reinforcement.html#:~:text=A%20variable%20ratio%20schedule%20is,one%20needed%20to%20receive%20reinforcement "Variable Ratio Reinforcement") are powerful learning mechanisms that grip our minds. When applied nefariously, they can cause irreversible damage to even the [most smart, hardworking, and loving individuals.](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/12/losing-it-all/505814/ "Painful Story")

### And, If you're not careful, they will also stop you from becoming a computer programmer.###

<br>
Variable ratio reinforcement scheduling is just a psychologist’s way of describing slot machine style learning systems. Although most people understand slot machines have serious psychological risks, not all variable ratio reinforcement is bad. In fact, you probably use variable ratio reinforcement to successfully navigate your daily life.

#### Super common variable ratio reinforcement examples:

- Frequently thanking you partner for washing the dishes.
- Occasionally high fiving your toddler for sharing with a friend
- Sorting your junk mail in hopes to find your Amazon package

So why am I arguing that variable ratio reinforcement can fundamentally prevent new programmers from learning the craft?

### Because a novice programer often views the keyboard like a slot machine lever.

When you start out programming, you learn how to write very simple programs with very simple syntax. Your terminal may throw an error or two and you add a semicolon or a close parenthesis. Eventually you hit the right combo and are hit with a fat reward! You printed out a fun (and probably profane) message to the screen and it feels damn good if you are even the least bit nerdy. A few more iterations through this stimulus/response cycle and you have been trained by variable ratio reinforcement to make some quick superficial changes to your code in order to get that sweet dopamine hit of a clean compile.

As time moves on, your learning exercises get a bit more complex. Maybe you forget there is a difference between the function find() and findIndex(), but it doesn't matter because you’re happily programming. Your code is running but it's not working as you intended. Although the best approach would be to pause and verify you understand each line of code, you have been shaped to do something else! You start changing some code around without thinking too hard and eventually change find() to findIndex(). Maybe you remembered there was another function with that name, or maybe IntelliSense gave you the assist. Either way, your code works as intended again and you didn't even have to look at documentation! Slot machine style debugging has extended its roots deeper into your limbic system all because of variable ratio reinforcement!

A novice programmer can effectively roleplay as a slot machine for a while. Even when faced with especially difficult problems, a novice programmer often will continue banging stuff together with a desperate hope of winning the jackpot. It's not completely their fault. Behaviors trained by variable ratio reinforcement are more resistant to extinction than those trained by any other reinforcement schedule
